Good Afternoon!!
   We, team Steller_nexus are glad to present in front of you our final project(prototype).
   We all have wondered at some point if we are alone in this universe. We earthlings as a community have a lot of knowledge about our solar system but very few know in depth about planets
outside the solar system. So we aim to make this info as interesting and interactive as possible.
   We all know there are already enough websites on this topic in fact we get space news on crome highlights too. So what is the actual problem here?
   First Problem in the website where we can get all the info is it itself, when a normal person opens such website and there is info of about 5000 exoplanets in front of him, it becomes 
too overwhelming for him and he avoids visiting again.
   Second Problem is with the crome highlights, it is that a person just reads the headline and skips.
   Considering these two problems we designed this prototype.
   So we have created a website which will upload info about 2-3 exoplanets everyday along with interactive videos and gifs. Also it will provide an interesting quiz regarding the info 
provided that day. This blog like website with quiz will make one reviste the website everyday to maintain the streak.
   In this way neither the person will be overwhelmed nor it will be one way interaction as the person gets to prove himself by answering the quiz. In this way the interactive part of the 
website makes it compatible for people of all age groups to learn without getting bored or overwhelmed.
